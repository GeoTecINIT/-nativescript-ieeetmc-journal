# NativeScript Task Dispatcher for Reliable Android Task Scheduling


This repository is the reproducibility package for the article â€œUsing mobile Devices as Scientific Measurement Instruments: Reliable Android Task Scheduling". In terms of software, the paper provides to main outputs. The first and most important is the **NativeScript Task Dispatcher** library, see [https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher](https://github.com/GeoTecINIT/nativescript-task-dispatcher) ([10.5281/zenodo.4530103](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4530103)). The second is the analysis and results of one of the experiments reported in the article (*Experiment 1: simple task scheduling*), which is the focus of this repository.

## Reproduce online
